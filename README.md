An overview of the Boston Housing Price Prediction project 

1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset (features like CRIM, RM, LSTAT, etc., with PRICE as the target)

Techniques:

Handling missing values (if any)

Normalization/standardization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots

Feature selection based on correlation and domain insight

2. Regression Modeling (Predicting Continuous House Prices)
Algorithms Used:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)

Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

3. Classification Task (Converting PRICE to Categories)
Approach:

Converted the continuous PRICE into binary or multi-class categories:

Example: High-priced vs Low-priced homes using a median or custom threshold

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Classification Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC (for binary classification)

4. Ensemble Learning
Methods:

Bagging with Random Forests

Boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting or XGBoost if used)

Helped improve accuracy and reduce overfitting

5. Insights and Conclusions
Identified the most important features influencing house prices (e.g., RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO)

Found that ensemble models (like Random Forest) gave better performance in both regression and classification

Demonstrated how regression models can be adapted into classification by bucketing price ranges
